  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Playing <a href="https://www.tennis.com/">Tennis</a> and <a href="https://www.nba.com/">Basketball</a></strong></li>
    <p>
      My love for sports in general came from a very young age but my love for basketball came from when my mom put me in a recreational league
      and since then I never looked back. With a sport like tennis I always enjoyed watching the pros do what they do best until I had to play
      one day and realized how bad I was and ever since that moment I devoted 2 hours everyday to hone my craft and become the best I possibly
      could be.
    </p>
    <li><strong>Cooking and Baking</strong></li>
    <p>
      I wanted to get good at cooking because everyone needs to eat and I always thought to myself why not eat great food everyday.
    </p>
    <li><strong>Playing <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/home">Video Games</a></strong></li>
    <p>
      In 2006, my family got my brother and I a PS2 with NBA Live 06' which would give me a lifetime of happiness and an endless amount of creative ability.
      Through the years my videogame interests changed from sports to first-person shooters thus, which interested me in the Computer Science field because
      coding allows people to create magical things like videogames and websites.
